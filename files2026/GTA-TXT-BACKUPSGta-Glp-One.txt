Only one hot girl... standing behind flannel shirt and greyish shirt.
Rest mediocre and most fattish (not fat)
Kinda nice seeing female programmers, complete nerd dungeons and dragons crew would also not be linked I guess?

Re: Thats way too much estrogen for a good gta game HARD PASS
One problem with the angle here is that it is not showing reality. That is not the entire staff, they are still far from an all female company, and that is not an image representing the people making gta.
Some of them sure, but images showing only women are were not taken in a GTA context.
Media and social media have used said images in their culture wars sure, but this is not the reason gamers should be worried about this game.
GTA games set the bar for the rest of the industry in terms of coding/content quality and pricing, and right now all factors work against the consumers. Prices will go up but the relative quality will go down
- for all games. Women in of itself is not a driving factor in that dynamic. It is a minor factor sure, but is not why this game will not live up to the hype.

Re: Thats way too much estrogen for a good gta game HARD PASS
the whole dei agenda is definitely a black ops psy program to socially engineer america. in this instance, through video games, because it's the perfect medium.
super immersive, super detailed, highly fantastical, and yet highly realistic. you couldn't ask for a better interface with the human brain in order to 'soft' rewire it.
all those people coming in at the same time from the same company, and just taking over this company, and likely the industry, in order to transform it fundamentally. it's a cia / mossad mind kontrol operation obviously. the claim is that they are wanting to promote 'diversity' or whatever, but i bet it goes a lot deeper than that, and that's just the surface cover explanation.
not anything new, for them to be infiltrating the game industry, but this has the appearance of a full on takeover. quite interesting, at the least.

That company is sinking low by showing that fake photo in order to virtue signal.
Won't be buying their crap products now.
